Simple is effective

Hi all. I am CS and math teacher by profession. I didn't do much code for many years, but got interested on Python programming
a few years ago. I have been experimenting a litle with pygame, since I taught my students to program with that.

Now I'm playing around with AI/ML and want to design my own swarm intelligence for research. Im also open to collaboration and joining 
projects with similar interests. My strong areas are logical thinking, creativity and math. I could use help with modern programming, 
best practises, UI/web Design, frameworks etc.
